# Trace-model test kit

This kit holds sample records, expected answers and a runner for the checks in [issue #42](https://github.com/aaif/wg-observability-and-traceability/issues/42). Each case is an OTLP/JSON trace export plus the answer a correct reader derives from it. Any OTel tooling can read the records, and no new runtime or backend is needed. Every check here is deterministic; live integration tests belong in a separately labeled job.

## Run it

```sh
pip install -r test-kit/requirements.txt
python3 test-kit/run.py                              # every case answers as expected
python3 test-kit/run.py --reader naive --expect-fail # a reader that trusts the producer fails
python3 test-kit/generate.py --check                 # the fixtures match a rebuild from the seed
```

## Cases

The records follow the support workflow in the execution plan. The agent proposes creating a ticket as action P1, and the action executes. An independently instrumented test service records the creation and signs a receipt. [mapping.md](mapping.md) declares the R1, R5 and R6 link methods used by these records.

| Case | What a correct reader answers |
| --- | --- |
| effects-receipt-delivered-twice | The same receipt arrives twice, and the reader reports one confirmed ticket by correlation. This case does not ask for a signature verdict. |
| effects-receipt-missing | No receipt arrives, so the effect is unconfirmed, which is different from "not created". |
| effects-ticket-id-changed | One receipt names `T-2088`. A count or receipt ID alone cannot answer the ticket-ID question. |
| effects-action-id-reused-in-another-scope | Both tenants reuse action `P1` and receipt `R-9`. Only the receipt in the queried tenant confirms its ticket. |
| evidence-grade-pair-verifies | The service receipt correlates to the action, and its signature verifies against the service's key. |
| evidence-grade-pair-fails | The service receipt still correlates to the action, but its signature fails. Correlation does not turn that signature into verified evidence. |

The last two cases are the fixture pair from section 3.3 of the MCP boundary deep dive. A consumer does not report a property it has not re-derived from the record and from the external party that property names. Both records carry the agent's own claim that the effect was externally verified. A reader that repeats that claim cannot tell them apart. The expected answer keeps effect correlation and `receipt_signature_verified` separate.

## Which document each answer follows

Each case carries `basis.json`, which names its checks and their source, so a reader can decide whether a case is in scope without opening `expected.json`. The effects cases follow [issue #42](https://github.com/aaif/wg-observability-and-traceability/issues/42) and section 6 of the shared contract draft (#51, v0.7-draft). The evidence-grade pair also checks signatures under section 3.3 of the MCP boundary deep dive (#32). A reader built only to v0.7 can answer effect correlation in the pair, but not signature validity. The runner refuses to run a case with no usable `basis.json`.

`evaluation_context` in `basis.json` supplies the action, service and tenant to query. The runner derives its answer before opening `expected.json`; expected fields never select the query. The scope case follows identity rule 4 of the same contract. Its `tenant.id` resource attribute is a fixture choice for the scope representation the draft leaves open.

## Signing input

The test service signs five receipt fields: `action_id`, `created_at`, `receipt_id`, `service` and `ticket_id`. Each comes from the receipt span attribute of the same name with the `receipt.` prefix removed, except `receipt_id`, which comes from `receipt.id`. The signing input is those five fields serialized as one JSON object with the keys in ascending order, no whitespace between tokens, and ASCII escapes for any non-ASCII character, encoded as UTF-8. For receipt R-7 in `evidence-grade-pair-verifies` the input is these 126 bytes:

```
{"action_id":"P1","created_at":"2026-09-21T15:00:00Z","receipt_id":"R-7","service":"test-ticket-service","ticket_id":"T-1042"}
```

The signature is Ed25519 over those bytes, carried in `receipt.signature` as standard base64 with padding. The verification key is `trust/test-ticket-service.pub.pem`, a PEM-encoded SubjectPublicKeyInfo holding a raw 32-byte Ed25519 public key. In `evidence-grade-pair-fails` the service signed `"ticket_id":"T-9999"` while the span reports `T-1042`, so the signature does not verify against the input the span describes.

## Readers

The reference reader joins the service receipts to the action using mapping.md, then checks signatures only where `basis.json` asks for it. The naive reader counts receipt spans and repeats the agent's claim. CI requires the naive reader to fail each case listed as discriminating in run.py, because a case it passes separates nothing.

### Recorded second-reader run

[Rul1an's reader output](https://github.com/Rul1an/aaif-trace-reader/tree/c298e7d54b9892810bd643420fe395c6d22ad207/results/4a02867) was frozen before comparing the expected files at kit revision `4a02867`. Its [comparison](https://github.com/Rul1an/aaif-trace-reader/blob/5036716e05310a3e0b1be7e46a492ff030a49e8c/results/4a02867/comparison.json) matches action and effect in all four original cases, and a separate signature check matches both pair cases. Ticket IDs were unscored. Both readers applied the declared R1/R5/R6 mapping; the README already stated the outcomes. That run establishes those field matches at that revision. It does not cover the two new cases.

## Fixtures

The generate.py script rebuilds each fixture from a published seed, and the key it derives signs synthetic receipts only. Ed25519 signatures are deterministic, so a rebuild is byte-identical, and CI checks that. Attribute names are illustrative fixture identities, not proposed OTel attribute names.

## Contributing a case

Copy the TEMPLATE directory and follow its mapping.md. Cases for continuity, calls and retries, and approvals follow the shared contract in [issue #41](https://github.com/aaif/wg-observability-and-traceability/issues/41). The cases here need only the effect and its receipt.
